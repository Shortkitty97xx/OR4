These case studies illustrate different aspects of implementing change to enable recognition and reward for open research within research-performing organisations. They are provided by institutions that have participated in the OR4 project, and are designed to complement the [implementation guide](guide-contents.qmd). Each case study is linked to the section of the implementation guide which it mainly illustrates, although case studies natuarally bear on many different aspects of institutional action discussed in the guide. 

Institutional policy and practice in this area is in many cases at an early stage, as the OR4 project's 2023 [survey of UK institutions](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z52cn) established. We are working with a number of participating institutions to develop and publish case studies over the coming months. We also welcome proposals for case studies from institutions that are not currently part of the OR4 community of practice. If you are interested in providing a case study for the toolkit, please review the case study brief provided here and contact [Robert Darby](mailto:r.m.darby@reading.ac.uk) with your proposal or any enquiries.
