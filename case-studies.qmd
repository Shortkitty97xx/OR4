These case studies illustrate different aspects of implementing change to enable recognition and reward for open research within research-performing organisations. They are provided by institutions that have participated in the OR4 project, and are designed to complement the [implementation guide](guide-contents.qmd). Each case study is linked to the section of the implementation guide which it mainly illustrates, although case studies natuarally bear on many different aspects of institutional action discussed in the guide. 

## Share your case study in open research recognition and reward

Institutional policy and practice in this area is in many cases at an early stage, as the OR4 project's 2023 [survey of UK institutions](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z52cn) established. We are working with a number of  institutions in the OR4 community of practice to develop and publish case studies. 

We also welcome proposals for case studies from the institutions in the wider higher education and research community. We want to hear from you whether you are taking first steps to develop strategic action or have examples of mature practice to share.  We will give you a platform to showcase your leadership in open research and to share good practice with the community. We are happy to have a conversation with you to discuss activity at your institution and to help you develop your case study. 

If you are interested in providing a case study for the toolkit, please follow these steps:

- Review the case study brief provided here to check your case study will be a fit for this resource. 
- Send us a proposed title and brief description of the case study, indicating which section(s) of the [implementation guide](guide-contents.qmd) it would primarily illustrate.
- We will discuss the case study with you and check that it will meet our criteria.
- Further to consideration we will invite you to submit a full draft of the case study using the template provided in the case study brief.

To submit a cae study proposal and for all other enquiries please contact [Robert Darby](mailto:r.m.darby@reading.ac.uk).
