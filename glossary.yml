Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment: |
  Published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment, the Agreement is based on ten commitments, and establishes a common direction for research assessment reform to which organisations can subscribe. Signatory institutions agree to undertake a reform of their research assessment criteria, tools and processes in line with the Agreement's Principles and core Commitments. They commit to develop and share with the CoARA within one year of signing the Agreement an action plan for ‘reviewing or developing criteria, tools and processes in line with the core Commitments’. They also agree to regularly demonstrate progress against this action plan, with a touch point at the end of 2027 or within five years of signing the Agreement.
Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA): |
  Signatories to the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment can apply to become members of the CoARA. Membership of the international Coalition  provides access to tools, networks and working groups to facilitate sharing of good practice and rapid capability-building.
Open research: |
  Research and research outputs that are accessible, transparent, reproducible (where relevant) and re-usable. Open research practices include open access publication of research, and sharing other research and research-related outputs as openly as possible using standard licences that facilitate re-use. Relevant outputs may include research data, code, software, digital resources, preregistered study designs, methods and protocols, preprints, peer reviews and hardware designs. Open research may also include citizen science that involves members of the public in the design and execution of research. The principles of open research are affirmed in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science adopted by its 193 member states (see entry below), and are widely recognised by funders  and research-performing organisations.  Definitions of all major open science terms and initiatives, alongside further supporting resources, can be found in the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training Glossary.
Research leaders and managers: |
  Those with senior level responsibility for research strategy and performance, such as PVCs for Research or Deans, and those with management responsibility for researchers and research activity within organisational units of the institution, such as heads of faculties, schools, departments or research divisions.
Researchers: |
  Anyone engaged in undertaking research and producing research outputs. While the focus of this resource is on practices for the assessment of researchers employed by research organisations, it may also be relevant to others who make contributions to research which may be recognised and rewarded by organisations, including research professionals, such as data scientists and research software engineers, and research students.
Responsible research assessment: |
  Research assessment that is aligned to the principles of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), the Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics,  the Metric Tide report,  and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment. Responsible research assessment is an essentially qualitative exercise, in which quantitative indicators are used appropriately in support of expert peer review. It is transparent in its criteria and methods, recognises the full range of activities and outputs that contribute to the quality and impact of research in addition to the production of peer-reviewed publications, and it values integrity, rigour and openness in the conduct and communication of research. It recognises the variety of roles and career pathways in research, and acknowledges and promotes diversity, equality and inclusiveness.
Recognition and reward: |
  HR frameworks frequently discuss ‘reward and recognition’ together, as a unitary concept.  Here we understand reward as ‘a mostly monetary or tangible acknowledgment of someone’s efforts or success’.  By contrast, recognition is largely relational, as captured in the acknowledgment of someone’s success through verbal or written feedback as well as via representational mechanisms, such as awards or prizes.  As a project, our focus is mainly on reward,  with particular emphasis on career advancement through recruitment or promotion.
DORA: |
  Published in 2013, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment was the first substantial initiative to articulate the case for research assessment reform.  Many institutions and individuals have signed up to the Declaration and initiated reform activities based on its recommendations. It has become a worldwide initiative covering all scholarly disciplines and all key stakeholders including funders, publishers, professional societies, institutions, and researchers.
Stakeholder group: |
  A group of stakeholders representing relevant areas of interest and knowledge within the institution convened to undertake action related to a defined strategic objective, such as development of open research culture and practice, or implementation of responsible research assessment policy and practice.
UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science: |
  Adopted in November 2021 by the 193 UNESCO member states, the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science provides an international framework for open science policy and practice.  It 'outlines a common definition and shared values, principles and standards for open science at the international level, and it proposes actions to support fair and equitable open science for all, at individual, institutional, national, regional and international levels'.
