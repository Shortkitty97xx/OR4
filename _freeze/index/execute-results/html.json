Open research practices include open access publication of research, and sharing other research and research-related outputs as openly as possible using standard licences that facilitate re-use. Relevant outputs may include research data, code, software, digital resources, preregistered study designs, methods and protocols, preprints, peer reviews and hardware designs. Open research may also include citizen science that involves members of the public in the design and execution of research. The principles of open research are affirmed in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science adopted by its 193 member states (see entry below), and are widely recognised by funders  and research-performing organisations.  Definitions of all major open science terms and initiatives, alongside further supporting resources, can be found in the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training Glossary.</span></a> voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
