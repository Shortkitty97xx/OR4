# About OR4

The **Recognising and rewarding open research** toolkit is produced by the [Open and Responsible Researcher Reward and Recognition project](https://www.ukrn.org/open-and-responsible-researcher-reward-and-recognition-or4/) (OR4). OR4 is a project of the [Open Research Programme](https://www.ukrn.org/open-research-programme/), a national initiative to accelerate the uptake of open research practices, supported by Research England and led by the UK Reproducibility Network. The aim of OR4 is to support the implementation of recognition and reward for open research through institutional researcher assessment practices. The project runs from 2021 to 2027.
