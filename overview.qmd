# OR4 toolkit overview

The OR4 toolkit consists of two main components:

- a [maturity framework and self-assessment tool](maturity-framework.qmd) that institutions can use to assess their maturity in the implementation of relevant policies and procedures, to support internal discussion and planning, and to measure ongoing progress 

- an [implementation guide](guide-contents.qmd) consisting of an introduction and sections linked to corresponding action areas in the maturity framework, providing detailed practical guidance to support assessment, planning and progress. The guide is illustrated with case studies from institutions that have participated in the OR4 project and includes resources developed by participating institutions to support implementation of open research reward and recognition. A [Glossary of key terms](glossary.qmd) is included.

The maturity framework and the linked guide are organised in nine action areas under three themes, as follows: 

#### Strategy and leadership
1. Institutional commitment
2. Leadership
3. Strategy and planning

#### Implementation
4. Communication and engagement
5. Policy and procedure
6. Support, systems and processes 
7. Guidance and training

#### Managing progress
8. Monitoring and evaluation
9. Research planning

## How to use the toolkit

Each of the nine action areas represents an aspect of institutional activity through which recognition and reward for open research can be operationalised. These different aspects are interrelated, and must all be addressed to some degree if recognition and reward for open research is to be effectively implemented. 

An assessment undertaken using the maturity framework and the self-assessment tool will generate an overall picture of institutional maturity across all nine action areas at a given point in time. It can enable a group of stakeholders to establish a baseline, identify and focus on the target level of maturity in each action area, plan the means by which this target can be attained, and in due course to measure progress.

The implementation guide can be used to develop a shared understanding of the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research practice and to explore different aspects of implementation in greater depth, in order to support informed planning and implementation.

The toolkit is organised broadly according to the logic of implementation, which might begin with institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform and conclude with effective integration of recognition and reward for open research as part of researcher assessment practice. The logic is not necessarily linear: in practice, actions in different areas may be more or less co-ordinated, and may be concurrent or undertaken at different times and in different sequences. Institutions will have different starting points and different objectives. The framework is not meant to prescribe a single route to a fixed destination, but to facilitate the development of a plan adapted to the needs of the institution.
