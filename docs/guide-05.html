<ul>
<li><p>Recognition and reward for open research must be incorporated into policy, with defined expectations and responsibilities, in order to be effectively implemented and to be able to support long-term cultural change. A number of policies and procedures will be affected – those related to recruitment, probation, promotion, performance and development review, and possibly others. If policies are not aligned and co-ordinated, this may result in inconsistent practices and mixed messages, which will undermine the policy objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>It will be essential to secure the buy-in of related policy owners and the support of those responsible for their implementation. Changes to systems and processes and responsibilities of support staff may be required and would need to be discussed and agreed.</p></li>

<p>Recognition and reward for open research will be relevant to and require incorporation in a range of institutional policies and procedures, including those concerning recruitment, academic probation, promotion and professorial review, performance and development review, and any other processes involving research appraisal and reward allocation. This will be important to ensure that institutional systems of reward and recognition are aligned and consistent between themselves.</p>
<p>We believe the most effective way to achieve this alignment and ensure consistency across relevant policies is to create an institutional research assessment policy to which other policies can be linked. Such a policy would set out the general principles of research assessment, which would include expectations and responsibilities related to open research.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily the only option for implementing relevant policy provisions. They might also be progressively integrated into existing policies, for example, beginning with the academic promotion policy, then moving on to recruitment and probation, performance and development review, etc. This may be a more practicable option in some institutions.</p>

<p>The emphasis on open research as a dimension of research that should be considered in research assessment is relatively recent. (This is discussed in the <a href="./guide-intro.html">Introduction</a>.) Where institutions have adopted policies relating to research assessment, so far these have mostly been focused on publications and <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/statements-of-responsible-metrics-2/">the responsible use of publication metrics</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. There is consequently both a need to update existing research assessment policies and a lack of established models for policies that reflect a broader concept of responsible research assessment, especially any that include explicit recognition of open research.</p>
<p>There is also the challenge of articulating open research expectations and requirements fairly, and in a meaningful and realistic way, within any research assessment policy, given that current awareness and practice on the part of researchers are at a relatively low level. Any policy must take account of various factors, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>researchers will come from different institutional and cultural backgrounds, which will have influenced the degree to which they are aware of and have had opportunity to use open research practices;</p></li>
<li><p>the relevance of open research practices and benchmarks will vary by discipline and type of research. Some disciplines may have more advanced cultures of data sharing or using pre-registration that others; some types of research may not necessitate the use of certain practices: data sharing expectations cannot apply where research has not involved collecting data. Policy expectations must be formulated in such a way that they can be applied in ways that are meaningful for specific disciplines and, within disciplines, for specific types of research;</p></li>
<li><p>the existence and scale of any track record in open research will depend on the career stage of the applicant and their employment history, which may include career breaks and employment in industry or in other areas that have not provided opportunities to use open research practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Institutions will approach the development of policy, and the inclusion of open research within it, in different ways, but it will be important to ensure the process of policy development is inclusive and the end result embodies the values of the institution. The <a href="https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/">SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation</a> developed by the Institutional Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS) is an excellent practical model that can be used to support the implementation of responsible research evaluation. It includes a number of case studies that demonstrate how different institutions have used the Framework to develop research assessment policies.</p>

<p>Policies and procedures that would need to take account of open research criteria include those relating to recruitment and probation, promotion, and professorial review, performance and development review, and other forms of reward and recognition, e.g.&nbsp;awards of institutional funding and other prizes.</p>
<p>The process of updating policies and procedures is likely to require a substantive collaborative development and consultation phase and could be driven by a research assessment reform group, existing group with pre-existing authority in these areas, or empowered institutional lead or champion. There may be discussion with policy owners over the precise nature of the changes, how and by whom any support requirements will be met, and the provision of additional resources to support implementation. It will be important to reach agreement on these matters if the policy is to be implemented effectively. It will also be necessary to ensure there is appropriate reference to open research expectations/requirements in any update of related policy and procedure documents, and guidance and support are appropriately signposted. For example, an academic promotion framework may need to update its criteria to include specification of open research, with information for both promotion panels and candidates providing links to any relevant policy information, guidance and training.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-assessment-frameworks-and-open-science-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.4</span> Academic assessment frameworks and open science approaches</h3>
<p>Academic promotion and professorial review policies customarily define assessment frameworks in which a number of assessment criteria are identified, usually under broad categories such as Academic citizenship and leadership, Research, and Teaching and learning.</p>
<p>There have been some efforts to create models of academic assessment frameworks in which ‘open science’ is a defining dimension of academic activity and assessment. These have been European initiatives, where ‘open science’ may encompass not just open research activities and outputs, but other knowledge-related activities such as innovation, the creation of impact, public engagement, and teaching and supervision. These models of academic assessment frameworks may be of use to institutions that are planning or undertaking a review of academic development and assessment pathways and frameworks.</p>
<p>In such frameworks, recognition can be given not just for practising open research directly, but for contributing to a culture in which open research is practised, for example by delivering training in open research practices,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> by using open research products in teaching, or by developing or curating infrastructure that supports open research, e.g.&nbsp;community data standards. These frameworks are consistent with the ambition of CoARA to expand the range of activities and outputs recognised in research assessment.</p>
<p>In 2017 the EU report ‘Evaluation of research careers fully acknowledging Open Science practices’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> proposed an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) in which open science is a guiding principle, and the full spectrum of open science practices, including open access to publications, open data, open peer review, research integrity, citizen science and stakeholder engagement, is taken into account. In the proposed framework all aspects of a researcher’s career, output and activities are included in the assessment, and all outputs and activities are assessed on the basis of their degree of openness.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opusproject.eu/">OPUS project</a>, which began in 2022, has built on the foundation laid by OS-CAM to produce a comprehensive <a href="https://opusproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OPUS_D3.1_IndicatorsMetrics_FINAL_PUBLIC.pdf">researcher assessment framework</a> which includes an open science dimension designed to support recognition and reward for open science practices. The framework is being tested and refined in collaboration with pilot institutions. It uses a modular design so that the framework can be customised to meet the requirements of the individual institution.</p>

<p>A review of promotion and progression in 2017 included recommendations to review the promotion criteria for Associate Professor and Professor, which resulted in a new <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/hr/policies/promotion/">Academic Promotions Framework</a> (APF) that launched in the 2020-2021 academic year. The APF looks to nurture individual and team excellence through clear descriptions of the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by our institution. This exercise resulted in the specific inclusion of open research practices as an example of the contributions recognised by the APF.</p>

<p>The Academic Promotions Framework provides four categories for applicants for promotion to demonstrate their achievements against: (1) Research (2) Education (3) Engagement &amp; Impact (4) Leadership &amp; Citizenship. Each has different criteria intended to cover the range of expectations and experiences across academic pathways, and the diversity of staff that work at the University.</p>
<p>The Research category captures what it takes to build our position as one of the world’s leading research-intensive universities. Criterion R-1 (Research Outputs) goes beyond just publications and other formal ways of presenting research findings, and explicitly includes open research outputs.</p>
<p>For an individual to be recognised for demonstrating open research outputs within the R-1 criterion, they must evidence: ‘Producing open research outputs as appropriate by adopting good practice in, for example, sharing data and code, sharing materials, sharing digital outputs, publishing preprints and pre-registering study protocols’.</p>

<p>As a founding member of UKRN, and lead organisation on the UKRN Open Research Programme, we recognised the need to demonstrate sectoral leadership to incentivise uptake of open research practices. Through the Research Improvement Group (now Research Culture Committee), chaired by Professor Marcus Munafò as UKRN Institutional Lead for Bristol, we liaised with those undertaking work on the development of a new Academic Promotions Framework.</p>

<p>The aim of the Academic Promotions Framework programme was to create an academic career path that is challenging, rewarding and inclusive, and which enables all academic staff to have the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the University needed to recognise and reward the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by the institution in ways that are transparent, accessible and sustainable. At the same time, our role in UKRN and our long history of sectoral leadership on open research practices meant that the Academic Promotion Framework programme presented an opportunity to embed incentives to promote uptake of these practices.</p>

<p>The Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost was the senior sponsor of the Academic Promotion Framework programme, and chaired a Programme Board made up of senior stakeholders across the institution. Having a senior sponsor for the change was imperative to promote the strategic importance of creating the APF, and in navigating resistance to the change in the process.</p>
<p>The facilitators and Programme Managers of the change were the Academic Staff Development team, operating as part of the Academic Career Development Programme. The University’s commitment to external agreements such as DORA and the Concordat on Open Research Data also established a basis for including open research practices: ‘the production of open research data should be acknowledged formally as a legitimate output of the research process and should be recognised as such by employers… in contributing to an individual’s professional profile in relation to promotion’.</p>
<p>Professor Marcus Munafò worked with members of the Programme Board and Academic Staff Development team to argue for the inclusion of open research practices in the Academic Promotions Framework, and developing the corresponding wording.</p>

<li>Staff Engagement Group Representative</li>
<li>Head of Academic Staff Development</li>
</ul>
<p>As the concept and practical resources for the Academic Promotions Framework evolved, there was also significant consultation across the institution for feedback. This included (but was not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heads of School across all Faculties</li>
<li>Deans and Pro Vice Chancellors across all Faculties.</li>
<li>School Managers across all Faculties</li>
<li>HR Business Partnering and Central HR Operations teams</li>

<p>For the Academic Promotions Framework to be adopted into practice, other changed were required, such as establishing a Faculty Promotions Committee for each Faculty.</p>
<p>In particular, narrative writing workshops for building a promotion case within the Academic Promotions Framework were set up to help applicants understand the criteria and how to demonstrate that these had been met.</p>
<p>This provided staff with the means and understanding for them to be recognised and rewarded appropriately, via a promotions case, both in general and specifically in relation to the inclusion of open research practices in their case if appropriate.</p>
<p>How was the change communicated within (and beyond) the institution?</p>
<p>In the development of the Academic Promotion Framework, its concept was shared within the consultation groups (see above). This was via focus groups and bespoke presentations, led by the Academic Career Development Programme.</p>
<p>The finalised versions of the Academic Promotions Framework are available to both internal colleagues and externally to the wider public via the University of Bristol website. As the APF versions evolved, this too was updated.</p>
<p>The links to the Academic Promotions Framework, and associated guidance documentation were shared via internal bulletins, and by relevant line managers, School and Faculty staff and Heads of HR Business Partnering, as their colleagues prepared their promotion cases.</p>
<p>In terms of the open research elements of the Academic Promotions Framework, these were promoted via the esearch Improvement Group and through related activities such as the Open Research Prize.</p>

<p>The need for a revised Academic Promotions Framework was first highlighted as a priority in December 2017. Shortly after its launch, the opportunity to use this to embed incentives for open research practices was recognised and pursued.</p>
<p>The Academic Promotions Framework launched in time for the 2020/2021 promotions cycle for Associate Professor/Professor grades, and extended to Research/Teaching Associates through to Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow grades in time for the 2021/2022 academic year.</p>

<p>There was a need to make allowances for adjustments in Schools to support individual and discipline-specific requirements and approaches. This was particularly true for open research practices, which are adopted to different degrees currently across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.</p>

<p>Promotion is a topic which intersects several others across the institution. For effective changes to be made to the benefit of individuals and the institutional strategy, there must be meaningful consultation with all those who would be potentially impacted.</p>
<p>The iterations that result from this consultation are made most effective when driven by a governance structure with clear accountability and responsibility of roles, working towards clearly defined objectives and timelines.</p>
<p>These issues are particularly salient in the context of open research practices, which are variably understood and engaged with across, for example, disciplines and career stage, meaning that the criteria needed to be sufficiently broad and flexible to accommodate this.</p>

<p>Senior Sponsorship is essential, and to provide direction and demonstrate institutional commitment.</p>
<p>Clear governance structures for decision making are required, including a clear Responsibility, Accountability, Consulted and Informed (RACI) model for the delivery of the project.</p>
<p>The inclusion of open research practices requires consideration of differences across, for example, disciplines and career stages, so that the relevant criteria are sufficiently broad and flexible.</p>
<p>Related to this point, it is essential to have a full Equity Diversity and Inclusion impact assessment conducted and continuously reviewed throughout the project, and post-implementation. This will ensure representation across our full diversity of colleagues, and allow the impact of the process to be proactively assessed via reporting in areas such as: gender, ethnicity, contract status and career pathway.</p>
