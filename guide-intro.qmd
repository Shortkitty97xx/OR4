# Why recognise and reward open research practice?

## Introduction

This introduction explains the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research in the assessment of researchers, with reference to the open research and responsible research assessment agendas that have evolved in recent years. It can be used as a reference text for a group of stakeholders undertaking a self-assessment exercise using the OR4 [maturity framework](maturity-framework.qmd), and to inform engagement in support of planned action, such as the development of business cases, dialogue with key stakeholders, and communications with the wider research community. It can serve to establish a shared understanding of open research and responsible research assessment, and an awareness of the drivers for strategic action in these areas in the higher education and research sector.

## Summary

Open research practices should be a part of researcher assessment, because a researcher who uses such practices better demonstrates, and enables verification of, the quality of their research; facilitates re-use of the products of their research, in this way maximising their potential value; and is able to provide a more representative picture of their research activities and outputs. Operationalisation of open research incentives and expectations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.

The importance and benefits of open research are widely accepted, and many institutions explicitly subscribe to open research principles. Policy drivers and compliance requirements related to open research are set to increase. But institutional commitments and open research policies are relatively unintegrated into research strategy, planning and management, and currently have limited influence on the behaviour of individual researchers. Systems of recognition and reward that operate in the recruitment, probation, promotion and appraisal of researchers can be powerful engines of behavioural change, but at present they do not effectively incentivise or reward open research practice. 

With momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Since the publication of the [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/read/) (DORA) in 2013, there has been an evolution in the research assessment reform agenda from an initial focus on responsible use of publication metrics towards a wider responsible research assessment framework. This has entailed increasing attention to elements related to research culture and research transparency and reproducibility, as represented most fully in the [Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment](https://coara.eu/) published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). 

This broader agenda is shaping the national research assessment framework in the UK as in other countries. The People, Culture and Environment element of the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) will include a greater emphasis on elements of research culture including open research. This is indicative of the direction of travel in the sector towards a more instrumental model of research assessment, in which open research is an integral feature. 

Institutions therefore need to start developing researcher assessment policies to integrate recognition and reward for open research. This work will involve a number of challenges of implementation, which can be characterised at four levels: 

- political: getting buy-in from institutional leaders and managers and key stakeholders in professional services to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures
- cultural: securing assent from members of the research community in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment to the inclusion of open research in research assessment and bringing about changes in practice; 
- practical: defining open research in such a way that instances of it can be demonstrated, identified, validated, and qualitatively evaluated within the context of an overall assessment, and providing the training and guidance that enables researchers and assessors to use the criteria effectively; 
- operational: implementing the changes to policies and procedures and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, and monitoring and managing compliance with implemented policies. 

The OR4 implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.

## Open research and its benefits 

UKRI [describes open research](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/) in the following terms:

> Open research, also widely referred to as open science, relates to how research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. It also enables research to take advantage of digital technology.
>
> Transparency, openness, verification and reproducibility are important features of research and innovation. Open research helps to support and uphold these features across the whole lifecycle of research – improving public value, research integrity, reuse and innovation.
>
> Open research also helps to support collaboration within and across disciplines. It is integral to a healthy research culture and environment. 

Open research can be situated in the context of a global discourse about open knowledge and openness in academic practice that often uses the term open science. In the open knowledge paradigm, ‘openness’ is integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated, evaluated, validated and instrumentalised. Open research practice is held to have a direct relationship to research integrity (through transparency of methods and outputs), research quality (through the use of evidentiary and reproducible practices), sustainability (through use of appropriate standards and formats, preservation infrastructure, and persistent identifiers), and reach and impact (through the accessibility and re-usability of outputs).

## Why shuold open research be part of research assessment?

There are key reasons why open research practices are important in the context of research assessment:

- Open practices support and demonstrate research integrity and quality, by providing transparency about research methods and evidence, and enabling independent verification or reproduction of findings

- Open practices generate a variety of outputs in addition to research publications, such as datasets, software and digital resources, and facilitate their re-use, so maximising opportunities to generate further value

- The broader range of activities and outputs associated with open research practices facilitates a more rounded assessment of a researcher's activities and outputs than is possible where publications are the primary or exclusive focus of assessment.

A researcher who uses open research practices better demonstrates and enables verification of the quality of their research, maximises the potential of their research to generate value, and is able to provide a more representative picture of their research activities. 

Operationalisation of open research incentives and expectations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.

## Open research principles are widely accepted but not fully integrated into research practice

The importance of openness in research is acknowledged by governments, funders, and research-performing institutions. The principles of open research have gained widespread acceptance in recent years. The 2021 adoption by the UNESCO member states of its [Recommendation on Open Science](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546) marks a significant milestone in this respect. Many public research funders and most research institutions in the UK have established policies on open access to research publications and the management and sharing of research data, which are fundamental open research practices. More recently, some institutions have adopted [statements in support of open research](https://www.ukcorr.org/2020/12/02/open-access-is-not-enough-reproducible-science-research-and-scholarship/), endorsing the principles and aims of open research and encouraging use of relevant open research practices. 

But open research policies and statements are as yet relatively unintegrated into institutional research strategy and planning and actual research practice. Beyond high levels of compliance with open access mandates, driven in large part by the requirements of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), there is little evidence of widespread open research practice. Rates of effective data sharing are still low.^[See e.g.: Gabelica, M., Bojčić, R. and Puljak, L. (2022), 'Many researchers were not compliant with their published data sharing statement: a mixed-methods study'. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 150: 33-41. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.05.019>; Lucas-Dominguez, R. et al (2021), 'The sharing of research data facing the COVID-19 pandemic'. Scientometrics (2021). <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03971-6>.] Open research practices are for the most part not incentivised and rewarded; nor, with the exception of open access publication, are they systematically monitored or enforced, either by institutions or by the funders of research. 

## Systems of reward and recognition can drive changes in researcher behaviour and academic cultures

At present, very few institutional recruitment, promotion, probation and appraisal frameworks include reference to open research criteria or outputs other than research publications; standards and practices for evidencing a track record in open research are not well-established; and there is a lack of guidance, training and support related to open research for researchers and staff involved in assessment. In consequence, use of open research practices is rarely evidenced or considered in the formal assessment activities, and is not monitored by institutions.^[See: Pontika, N. et al. (2021), 'ON-MERRIT D6.1 Investigating institutional structures of reward & recognition in Open Science & RRI (1.0)'. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5552197>; Khan, H. et al. (2022), 'Open science failed to penetrate academic hiring practices: a cross-sectional study'. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 144: 136-143. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.12.003>.]  

With momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Universities play a critical role in the system of academic reward and recognition. It is in their power to include open research criteria in their recruitment specifications, probation objectives and promotion frameworks, performance and development review processes, and research planning activities. By this means researchers can be incentivised and supported to build a track record in open research and to present that track record in an assessment activity, while assessment practices can recognise and give credit for a record of open research practice. This will drive increased adoption of open research practices, and, in time, bear fruit in the recruitment and promotion of staff who are recognised for working in ways that increase the integrity, quality and impact of the institution’s research output.

## The history of research assessment reform can be characterised in terms of an evolution from an agenda focused almost exclusively on the use of publication-based metrics towards a broader framework of responsible research assessment (Figure 1). This broader, more instrumental agenda considers research assessment as a means of enabling the best researchers to flourish, promoting diversity and inclusion, and supporting the production of high-quality research – in short, as a means to engineer research culture. Within this agenda, there has been growing attention to the role of open research practices in relation to research assessment. 

![Figure 1. Milestones in the history of research assessment reform](images/figures/researchassessment-timeline.jpg)

The [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/read/) (DORA, 2013), the founding text of research assessment reform, was primarily concerned with research publications and related metrics, although its second recommendation for institutions states:

> For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.

But while DORA mentions datasets and software as examples of other research outputs, it lacks the broader concept of open research that has developed in the years since its publication, and it does not provide any guidance on how other types of output might be included and assessed. The [Leiden Manifesto](https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a) and the [Metric Tide report](https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/) (both published in 2015) were similarly focused on the use of publication metrics.

More recently a broader framework of responsible research assessment has emerged,^['The focus on responsible metrics has now been folded into the broader framework of responsible research assessment (RRA). This can be defined as "an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which incentivise, reflect and reward the plural characteristics of high-quality research, in support of diverse and inclusive research cultures".' Curry, S., Gadd, E. and Wilsdon J. (2022), 'Harnessing the metric tide: indicators, infrastructures and priorities for responsible research assessment in the UK'. Research on Research Institute. <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21701624.v2>, p. 23. The quotation refers to a paper from the Research on Research Institute that is perhaps the first to articulate this broader framework. See Curry, S. et al. (2020). The changing role of funders in responsible research assessment: progress, obstacles and the way ahead (RoRI Working Paper No.3). 10.6084/m9.figshare.13227914.v2. Research on Research Institute. <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13227914.v2>] within which increased attention to open research is evident. A white paper from the League of European Universities (LERU) published in 2018 recommended that universities ‘endeavour to integrate Open Science dimensions in their HR and career frameworks as an explicit element in recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement policies’.^[Ayris, P. et al (2018), 'Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change'. League of European Research Universities. <https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change>.] Also in 2018, the European Universities Association published the 'EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science', which argued:

> Today, research assessment and reward systems generally do not reflect important Open Science contributions, such as curating and sharing datasets and collections, documenting and sharing software (source code), or devoting time and energy to high-quality peer review. New approaches to research assessment that take into account Open Science contributions need to be identified and thoroughly discussed by academic communities.^[European Universities Association (2018), 'EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science'. <https://eua.eu/resources/publications/316:eua-roadmap-on-research-assessment-in-the-transition-to-open-science.html>.]   

The 'Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers' (2020) call for assessment to develop a much broader picture of a researcher’s contributions to research and society. It identifies as one of its five principles to ‘Reward the practice of open science (open research)’, and it makes a strong connection between research transparency and research integrity.^[Moher, D. et al. (2020). 'The Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers: Fostering research integrity'. PLoS Biol 18(7): e3000737. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737>.] The [UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546) (2021) enjoined member states to remove barriers to open science relating to research and career evaluation and awards systems, stating: 'Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science'.

In the [Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/), published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), ‘openness’ is recognised as being integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated and validated, and is identified as a key dimension of research assessment. Under the ‘Quality and impact’ principle of research assessment it states: ‘Openness of research, and results that are verifiable and reproducible where applicable, strongly contribute to quality’. Under the principle ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’, signatories agree to: 

> Consider… the full range of research outputs, such as scientific publications, data, software, models, methods, theories, algorithms, protocols, workflows, exhibitions, strategies, policy contributions, etc., and reward research behaviour underpinning open science practices such as early knowledge and data sharing as well as open collaboration within science and collaboration with societal actors where appropriate.

## National and institutional assessment practices need to develop

The greater emphasis on open research in the research assessment reform agenda is relatively recent, and national and institutional research assessment policies have so far reflected a prevailing focus on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics. In a survey undertaken by the OR4 project in 2023, 44 or 73% of 70 institutions stated that they had a responsible research assessment statement or policy. The majority of these were focused on the responsible use of publication metrics.^[Barnett, J. at al. (2024). 'OR4 Research Assessment Survey Report'. Working Paper No 5. <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z52cn>.] In scope and terminology many of these statements follow and reference DORA and the Leiden Manifesto. 

The almost exclusive focus on the assessment of research publications is understandable, given their prominence in the systems of academic recognition and reward. In REF 2021, of 185,353 outputs submitted, 180,509 or 97.4% fell into the main academic publications categories A-E (including authored and edited books, book chapters, journal articles and conference contributions). 154,826 outputs or 83.5% of the total were journal articles. The number of research data sets and databases submitted was 31; the number of software outputs was 11 (Figure 2).^[REF 2021 Submitted outputs' details. <https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/outputs>.]
