# Guide Introduction

The OR4 implementation guide provides detailed guidance for institutions on implementing effective recognition and reward for open research in researcher assessment. The guide is illustrated with case studies from universities that have participated in the OR4 project and includes resources developed by participating institutions to support implementation of open research reward and recognition. It can be used by a group of stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research practice and to explore different aspects of implementation in greater depth, in order so support informed planning and implementation. It can be used in conjunction with the maturity framework and as part of an institutional self-assessment exercise. 

The introductory section, Why recognise and reward open research practice? explains the rationale for strategic action with reference to the wider sector context. This overview can be used by members of a stakeholder group to establish a shared understanding and sense of purpose.  

The nine sections mapped to the action areas of the maturity framework are designed to enable members of the stakeholder group to develop a more in-depth understanding of the key areas in which action may be required, and to create a practical plan of action to develop institutional maturity.  

A Glossary of key terms is also included. 

Each section of the nine main sections of the guide follows a standard format: 

* Why is this important? 

* Maturity scale: the maturity scale for this action area 

* Progress actions: suggested key actions to move from one level of maturity (as defined by the maturity framework) to the next 

* Main areas of activity: in-depth guidance 

* Case studies: illustrating different aspects of implementation at UK institutions 

* Useful resources: links to useful resources that have been developed by institutions.
